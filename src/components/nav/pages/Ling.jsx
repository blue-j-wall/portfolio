                    <h2><Card.Title>Emojis</Card.Title></h2>
                    <Card.Text>This is an independent research project on ‚Äòinternet speech‚Äô. It covers how people use and perceive <strong>emojis/emoticons in texting and social media</strong>, and how that varies based on age.</Card.Text>
                    <Card.Text>It began when I noticed people‚Äîincluding myself‚Äîget annoyed when messaging apps autocorrect emoticons :) to emojis üôÇ, and that my peers described their parents‚Äô unironic, positive usage of smiley emojis as ‚Äúthreatening, unsettling, passive aggressive,‚Äù though unintentionally so.</Card.Text>
                    <Card.Text>This meant there must be an appreciable difference in perception, therefore:<br/><strong>Do digital natives see smiley emojis as less positive and emoticons as more positive?</strong></Card.Text>
                    <Card.Text>I carried out research on this question with the help of my PI, Prof. Eric Raimy. I put together a literature review and <strong>designed a survey</strong> based on preexisting studies. Because of the limitations of Qualtrics, I had the opportunity to apply my skills as a programmer and write JavaScript code to ‚Äòrandomize‚Äô the material correctly across respondents. The survey ended up getting over 200 responses.</Card.Text>
                    <Card.Text>Using R to visualize and analyze the data, I found statistically significant results that reflected my hypothesis. The paper is currently a work-in-progress.</Card.Text>

                    <h2><Card.Title>Phonetics</Card.Title></h2>
                    <Card.Text>In this pilot literature synthesis paper, I investigated <strong>differences in pronunciation between genders across the world‚Äôs languages.</strong></Card.Text>
                    <Card.Text>It was written for my capstone course in linguistics with Prof. Joe Salmons that covered laryngeal realism (LR), a phonological theory. The original goal was to find new evidence for the theory‚Äîspecifically sociolinguistic evidence, as the subfield hadn‚Äôt been covered much in class.</Card.Text>
                    <Card.Text>I focused on voice onset time, a phonetic feature important in LR, as my cross-linguistic gendered variable. There was no existing research on this, so I started from scratch by <strong>collecting 26 papers on 19 languages</strong> which contained relevant raw data.</Card.Text>
                    <Card.Text>I then analyzed these language-specific results through the lens of LR to find consistent phonological or phonetic patterns. Though the findings didn‚Äôt support or contradict the theory since the pattern was completely phonetic, I did get novel results on where gendered pronunciation differences occur: they tended to arise at the longest possible voice onset times.</Card.Text>
