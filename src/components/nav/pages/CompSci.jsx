                        <Card.Text>This project was originally conceptualized as a <strong>GUI for my 'media spreadsheets'</strong>. 
                            They contain information on things Iâ€™ve read and watched, and they all go back years, making them quite annoying to search through. 
                            This website makes it easier to look through the data for myself, and perhaps others in the future as well.</Card.Text>
                        <Card.Text>I designed and developed a <strong>responsive React frontend</strong> that allows users to easily see information on the movies, shows, etc they have added.
                            The backend uses <strong>Express.js</strong> and provides users the ability to search, add, remove, and edit entries in a <strong>SQLite database</strong>.</Card.Text>
                        <Card.Text>I'm looking forward to using this project to experiment more in the future. For instance, I plan to add a feature that can automatically
                            generate entries based off a link (eg. from IMDb), so that I can learn about and practice web scraping.</Card.Text>

                    <Card.Text> Most low-level linguistics courses require memorization and understanding of complicated concepts such as syntax trees and the IPA chart. 
                        However, many students find difficult to practice on their own, which I knew from personal experience.</Card.Text>
                    <Card.Text> I participated in a <strong>team of four to develop an app</strong> that addresses this problem; it offers quizzes and interactive activites that help 
                        linguistics students master introductory material. </Card.Text>

                    <Card.Text> My responsibilities were largely decided by my being the only team member with experience in linguistics.
                        I personally <strong>designed the prototype and tested the UX</strong> with target users, and during the implementation process I was in charge of the data.
                        After learning a lot about resources 
                        like <a href="https://universaldependencies.org/#english-treebanks" target="_blank">treebanks</a> (shown above) 
                        and <a href="https://github.com/CUNY-CL/wikipron/tree/master" target="_blank">WikiPron</a>
                        , I did the <strong>data wrangling and programming for the dataloader</strong>. I worked 
                        closely with my teammate tasked with the quizzes themselves to integrate our code.</Card.Text>
                    <Card.Text> Other features of the app include Firebase authentication, drag & drop actions, vibration feedback, and notifications.</Card.Text>
